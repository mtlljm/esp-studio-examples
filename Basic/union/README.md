# union

Merge three event streams of stock market trades together.

A Union window unites two or more event streams using a strict policy or a loose policy. Input windows that stream events to a Union window must have the same schema.

As this project contains multiple Source windows, when you use the Publish button in test mode, you must publish events for each Source window separately. You cannot publish events to multiple Source windows simultaneously.

SAS Help Center contains step-by-step instructions about how to create the project from scratch and how to execute it. For more information, see [Unifying Multiple Input Streams](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=espcdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=espstudio&docsetTarget=n0g474dl9rbsxdn1qkp6dszhi0xr.htm).
