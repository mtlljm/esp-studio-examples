# splitter

Use a splitter.

You can use expressions to define window-output splitter-slot calculations (for example, you can use an expression to evaluate where to send a generated event). In this project, the splitter works with user-defined functions to calculate the slot number to decide which Copy window the event goes to.

For more information about how to explore and test this project, see [Using the Examples](https://github.com/sassoftware/esp-studio-examples#using-the-examples).
