# New Project Template Instructions

This repository contains a template you can use to seed a repository for a
new open source project, following the [SAS Open Source Guidelines](https://gitlab.sas.com/techoffice/open-source-guide/blob/master/README.md). See [releasing a project](https://gitlab.sas.com/techoffice/open-source-guide/blob/master/docs/creating/RELEASING.md) for more information about
releasing a new SAS open source project.

This template uses the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), which is the SAS default.  See the
documentation for instructions on using alternate license.

## How to use this template

1. Navigate to https://gitlab.sas.com/projects/new
1. Select the **Import project** tab.
1. Choose to import from **Repo by URL**.
1. For the **Git repository URL** enter https://gitlab.sas.com/techoffice/new-project.git (**NOTE:** You must include the .git extension or the import will fail).
1. For the **Project name** enter the desired name for your project.
1. By default, the project will be created in your user space. If you want to create your project in a different location, specify that as part of the **Project URL**.
1. (Optional) Supply a project description.
1. Specify the **Visibility Level**. If you don't choose _Public_ (meaning open to all logged in SAS users) then you will need to provide access to any reviewers.
1. When you have supplied all the information, click the **Create project** button to create the project.

At this point, you will have a new Git repository that is populated with all of the new project template content.

**NOTE:** You should delete the INSTRUCTIONS.md file from your project before committing your changes.
