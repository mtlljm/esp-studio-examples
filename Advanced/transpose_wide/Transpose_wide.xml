  <description><![CDATA[This example conceptualizes an event as a row that consists of multiple columns. You can use a Transpose window to interchange an eventâ€™s rows as columns, and columns as rows. Use attributes of the Transpose window to govern the rearrangement of data. You will process information about the pitch, yaw, roll, and velocity of an aircraft in flight.

As the Transpose window has two modes, long and wide, this example consists of two parts:

Transpose aircraft information in wide mode. 
Transpose aircraft information in long mode. 
The long mode part of this example uses the following files:

The XML file (transpose_long.xml) associated with this example.
datafortransposition.csv. This is an input file. This file contains event streams from the aircraft in flight.
The wide mode part of this example uses the following files:

The XML file (transpose_wide.xml) associated with this example.
datafortransposition.csv. This is an input file. This file contains event streams from the aircraft in flight.]]></description>
