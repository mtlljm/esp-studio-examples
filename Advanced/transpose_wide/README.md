# transpose_wide

Transpose data from an aircraft, in wide mode.

This project conceptualizes an event as a row that consists of multiple columns. You can use a Transpose window to interchange an event's rows as columns, and columns as rows. You will process information about the pitch, yaw, roll, and velocity of an aircraft in flight.

SAS Help Center contains step-by-step instructions about how to create the project from scratch and how to execute it.
