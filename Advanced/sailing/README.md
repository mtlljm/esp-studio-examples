Visualize data obtained from a set of boats.

This example identfies two geographical areas of interest. One area is an exclusion zone that the boats identified are not permitted to enter. The other is an area where a speed restriction has been applied.

SAS Help Center contains step-by-step instructions about how to prepare the example in SAS Event Stream Processing Studio and then use SAS Event Stream Processing Streamviewer to visualize the data. For more information, see [Create a Sailing Data Dashboard](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=espcdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=espvisualize&docsetTarget=p19e6nvqc009hmn1kypsgyyexqdb.htm).
